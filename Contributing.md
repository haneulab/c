# Contribution Guidelines

When decided to contribute to this repository, please read the following and keep the repo's contribution rule. This is so that the repository content is consistent in design & its format as well as the module relevancy to help readers to browse & learn more effectively.

## Contribution Steps

Below is the direction as to how to start contributing properly using appropriate tools. Also **NOTE** that there are things that contributors have to abide by within the repository rule which will be described in the section below [Contribution & Review Request Mininum Requirements](#contribution-review-request-minimum-requirement).

#### ðŸš€ Clone The Repository

```bash
git clone "https://github.com/haneulab/c.git" ./c-docs
```

#### ðŸš€ Create Your Branch

```bash
git checkout -b <your_github_username>-branch
```

#### ðŸš€ Add Relevant Contents To Relevant Directory

The following content is an example demo for working in a directory in your new branch that you want to add to the repo.

```bash
# example : working in ./intro_to_c & creating if_else.c file
touch if_else.c
```

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    // if & else statement in C

    // CASE 1: if one line statement, brackets are not needed

    int i = 0;
    if(1)
        return 1;
    else
        return 0;
}
```

```bash
# compile
gcc if_else.c
# execute
./a.out
```

#### ðŸš€ Clean Up Unnecessary Files Or Directories From Development Setting

If you want to ignore some specific files (which you should such as executables & any environmental directories or dot files). The root directory's `.gitignore` might not cover all the things your local environment creates. Then you can simply add a .gitinore file in this working directory and add the line that specifies the file pattern you want to ignore.

```bash
touch ./gitignore
```

```bash
# .gitignore
...
*.out
*.o
```

#### Git Commit & Push to Your Branch

**Git Add**

```bash
# for adding all files you added
git add .
# for adding a specific file (or patterned)
git *.c
```

**Git COMMIT**

```bash
git commit -m "your message about your current action (added a file/updated a file/...)"
```

**GIT PUSH**

```bash
git push --set-upstream-branch origin <the_branch_name_you_checked_out>
```
