Today, we've talked about debugging in `C` Programs. 

In programming, we use the work `debug` as a verb to `catch a bug` in your code. 
For examle, the program code may be written correctly but it might not do (behave) what we expect. This is always a good practice (if not must) to debug your code until it has nearly performed 99.9% the same as we expected.
