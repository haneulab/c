# Guide To C Programming & Data Structure Implementation

This repository will provide useful resources & explanations from our **contributors** for specific concepts (of programming & C language).

Furthermore, we attempt to explain some of the most well-known data structures and how they can be implemented.

## Prerequsite Knowledge

The prerequsite knowledge might differ from topics to topics here. However the following gives you a generalized list of prerequsite concepts needed to help understand the targetted topics more effectively.

#### Knowledge

- **Previous Programming Experience** : Previous experience with another programming language will help a lot when trying to understand the documentation, but not absolutely required if you have dealt with basic to advance logical operations & mathematical backgrounds and so on.
- **Basic Mathematic Concepts** : `addition`, `subtraction`, `division`, `multiplication`, `remainder`, `syntactic definition of prime number, integer, float`, ...

## Corequsuite Software Tools

If you are planning to practice along with the documentation of the repo, you will be the following software tools to **compile** & **run** on specific files & commands in your machine.

**Command Line Interface**

We will need to have a `linux`-based `cli (command line interface)`. For _Window_ users, you may download any sub-linux distributions such as `ubuntu-20.+`. If you are a _MacOS_ user, you can directly run necessary commands on your `terminal` application.

**Code Editor**

We highly suggest that you use your `code editor` as one of the following along with `integrated terminal` in your editor application.

- **VSCode**
- **Atom**
- **VIM**
