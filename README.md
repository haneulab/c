**Working with Relative Paths**

Working with relative path pattern is often referred as writing file/directory names relative to your or the file's current path. To represent the current position (location) of the path, we 
express it as `.` *(dot)* notation

```bash
# I am in a folder called "workspace"

# create three folders in current directory
mkdir workA workB workC
# create three folders using relative paths in the current directory
mkdir ./workA ./workB ./workC
```

```bash
# create folder "newFolder" and a file "newFile.txt in it using relative path pattern
mkdir ./newFolder && touch ./newFolder/newFile.txt
```
